## Assigment 5 - Search Sorted 2D Array
You are asked to write an efficient algorithm to search a given key within a given 2D array, where every row and column is sorted in an ascending order. For example consider a 2D array. Every row and column is sorted. You are searching the 2D array for key 36.  

| 3  | 7  | 11 | 23 | 45 |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 5  | 9  | 13 | 25 | 50 |
| 7  | 14 | 15 | 30 | 55 |
| 10 | 18 | 22 | 34 | 62 |
| 16 | 24 | 29 | 38 | 88 |

Present pseudocode and code of an efficient algorithm for the search described above.  Your input array size is n x n.
